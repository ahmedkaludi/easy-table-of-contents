### Frequently Asked Questions

= Ok, I've installed this... what do I do next? =

You first stop should be the Table of Contents settings admin page. You can find this under the Settings menu item.

You first and only required decision is you need to decide which post types you want to enable Table of Contents support for. By default it is the Pages post type. If on Pages is the only place you plan on using Table of Contents, you have nothing to do on the Settings page. To keep things simple, I recommend not changing any of the other settings at this point. Many of the other settings control when and where the table of contents is inserted and changing these settings could cause it not to display making getting started a bit more difficult. After you get comfortable with how this works... then tweak away

With that out of the way make sure to read the **How are the tables of contents created?** FAQ so you know how the Table of Contents is automatically generated. After you have the page headers setup, or before, either way... Scroll down on the page you'll see a metabox named "*Table of Contents*", enable the *Insert table of contents.* option and Update and/or Publish you page. The table of contents should automatically be shown at the top of the page.

= How are the tables of contents created? =

The table of contents is generated by the headers found on a page. Headers are the [`<h1>,<h2>,<h3>,<h4>,<h5>,<h6>` HTML tags](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp). If you are using the WordPres Visual Post Editor, these header tags are used and inserted into the post when you select one of the [*Heading n* options from the formatting drop down](http://torquemag.io/wordpress-heading-tags/). Each header that is found on the page will create a table of content item. Here's an example which will create a table of contents containing the six items.

`<h1>Item 1</h1>
<h1>Item 2</h1>
<h1>Item 3</h1>
<h1>Item 4</h1>
<h1>Item 5</h1>
<h1>Item 6</h1>`

You can also create "nested" table of contents. This is difficult to explain so I'll illustrate building on the previous example. In this example a table of contents will be created with the same six items but now the first three will each an child item nested underneath it. The indentation is not necessary, it was only added for illustration purposes.

`<h1>Item 1</h1>
    <h2>Item 1.1 -- Level 2</h2>
<h1>Item 2</h1>
    <h2>Item 2.1 -- Level 2</h2>
<h1>Item 3</h1>
    <h2>Item 3.1 -- Level 2</h2>
<h1>Item 4</h1>
<h1>Item 5</h1>
<h1>Item 6</h1>`

You are not limited to a single a single nested item either. You can add as many as you need. You can even create multiple nested levels...

`<h1>Item 1</h1>
    <h2>Item 1.1 -- Level 2</h2>
        <h3>Item 1.1.1 -- Level 3</h3>
        <h3>Item 1.1.2 -- Level 3</h3>
        <h3>Item 1.1.3 -- Level 3</h3>
    <h2>Item 1.2 -- Level 2</h2>
      <h3>Item 1.2.1 -- Level 3</h3>
      <h3>Item 1.2.2 -- Level 3</h3>
      <h3>Item 1.2.3 -- Level 3</h3>
    <h2>Item 1.3 -- Level 2</h2>
<h1>Item 2</h1>
    <h2>Item 2.1 -- Level 2</h2>
    <h2>Item 2.2 -- Level 2</h2>
<h1>Item 3</h1>
    <h2>Item 3.1 -- Level 2</h2>
    <h2>Item 3.2 -- Level 2</h2>
<h1>Item 4</h1>
<h1>Item 5</h1>
<h1>Item 6</h1>`

You can nest up 6 levels deep if needed. I hope this helps you understand how to create and build your own auto generated table of contents on your sites!

= Is there any shortcode to add the table of content to anywhere I want ? =

Yes you can add the TOC with this shortcode - [ez-toc] and with the help of this you can easily add the TOC in the content or anywhere in the WordPress and if you want to add the shortcode on the theme file then you can add it with the help of this code - <?php echo do_shortcode( â€˜[ez-toc]â€™ ); ?> and with this, you can add the TOC on any file according to your need.
